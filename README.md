## Recommended IDE
[Wing IDE 101](https://wingware.com/downloads/wingide-101) was used to run the python files. This IDE was chosen as it is very simple to use. The [introductory course to computer science](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/csca08h3) at the University of Toronto Scarborough has used this IDE.
